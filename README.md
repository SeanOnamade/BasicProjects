BasicProjects - Overview
====================
This repository contains many basic projects I've been working on in various languages to improve my coding abilities. I made this repository as a simple place to store these projects!

# Dotify - Music Player
This is a music player app. A user can play and pause songs I've downloaded into a playlist. It's complete with an HTML interface.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
This was a crash course in simple full-stack development, as well as a side of Javascript I haven't seen before (i.e. its music-playing capabilities). Making this app was a lot of fun, and I sometimes keep the music on as I work or study.

Reviewing event listeners was a bit of a pain. Making the pause/play icon pulse when clicked, and ensuring the progress bar didn't mess up the songs' playback, was also an interesting challenge.

### Languages, softwares, and modules used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Run/Install

## Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors project in Python. The user simply chooses their input, and a random number generator chooses the opponent's.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
This project was simple enough, nothing crazy. I hope to add more to it later; perhaps a way to count points.

### Languages, softwares, and modules used
- Python

### Run/Install

## Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game that can be played with two players on one computer. It opens an interactive window, and the game can be replayed indefinitely.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
The Tkinter module was totally new to me, and I was pleasantly surprised by its capabilities. Getting things going was slow at first, and required some extra research. A lot of logic was needed compared to the simple RPS game. I also had to review the rules of tic-tac-toe. ðŸ˜‚

### Languages, softwares, and modules used
- Python
- Tkinter
- itertools

If you've gotten to the end of this, I hope you've liked my projects!
