# Dotify - Music Player
Dotify offers a great music listening experience, providing users (me) with a sleek and intuitive platform to enjoy their (my) favorite tunes. With its stylistic HTML interface, Dotify allows users to effortlessly navigate through a curated playlist, playing and pausing songs at their convenience. Whether one is unwinding after a long day or looking for some inspiration while working, Dotify is a go-to companion for seamless music playback.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
Developing Dotify was a crash course in simple full-stack development, allowing me to explore JavaScript's capabilities for playing audio. While creating this app, I encountered challenges related to managing event listeners and ensuring smooth playback while interacting with various UI elements. Overall, making this app was a lot of fun;  I sometimes play the music as I work or study.

## Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors project in Python. The user simply chooses their input, and a random number generator chooses the opponent's.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
This project was simple enough, nothing crazy. I hope to add more to it later; perhaps a way to count points.

### Languages, softwares, and modules used
- Python

### Run/Install

## Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game that can be played with two players on one computer. It opens an interactive window, and the game can be replayed indefinitely.

### What did I learn? What challenges were there?
The Tkinter module was totally new to me, and I was pleasantly surprised by its capabilities. Getting things going was slow at first, and required some extra research. A lot of logic was needed compared to the simple RPS game. I also had to review the rules of tic-tac-toe. ðŸ˜‚
